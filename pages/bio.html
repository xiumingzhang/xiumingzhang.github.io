      <p>
        Xiuming Zhang is currently a Principal Research Scientist in Prof. Sanja
        Fidler's Spatial Intelligence Lab at NVIDIA, working on generative world
        simulation for closed-loop training of physical AI agents. Prior to
        joining NVIDIA, he shipped Full Self-Driving (FSD) to both customer and
        Robotaxi fleets as part of the Tesla Autopilot team and worked on
        computational photography in Prof. Marc Levoy's Emerging Products Group
        at Adobe. In 2021, Xiuming earned his Ph.D. in computer vision and
        computer graphics with Prof. William T. Freeman at the Computer Science
        and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) of the Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology (MIT). At MIT, he also received mentorship from
        Dr. Jonathan T. Barron through internships at Google Research. Xiuming's
        doctoral dissertation
        <i>Shape, Reflectance, and Illumination From Appearance</i> studies
        inverse rendering and its applications, including 3D shape
        reconstruction and free-viewpoint relighting. Recognized by a Snap
        Research Fellowship in 2019, his research has been exhibited at the MIT
        Museum and covered by various popular press outlets, including BBC,
